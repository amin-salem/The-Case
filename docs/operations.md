# Operations

Notes for the operator (Amin). Other documents: `health-watch.md` (the GitHub watch workflows), `CLAUDE.md` (deploy budget).

## Admin app

A small Android app, `admin_app/`, that shows the admin web panel (`/admin/ui`) full-screen on your phone. It is a thin
wrapper: it shows exactly what `/admin/ui` shows, so **new panel features and the Health page appear without a new APK**.
It is only sideloaded (never published in a store). **Do not share the APK or the admin key.**

- **Install:** open the repository's Releases on GitHub on your phone, download `parvandeh-admin.apk` from the release
  `admin-latest`, open it and allow installing from this source (the browser or file manager) when Android asks.
  Updating = download and install again (same signing key, so it updates in place).
- **First start:** the app asks for the lock (fingerprint or phone lock, if the phone has one), then for the admin key
  (`ADMIN_API_KEY`) once. The key is stored with the Android Keystore (flutter_secure_storage), never in the APK or repo.
  On every page load the app opens `https://gaamly.ir/admin/ui#k=<key>`; the page reads the fragment once, signs in and
  removes it from the address bar (a fragment is never sent to the server).
- **Settings (gear icon):** server (`https://gaamly.ir`, or the old `https://thecase.liara.run` as a fallback), lock on open
  (default on if the phone supports it), hide the screen from screenshots and recent apps (Android FLAG_SECURE, default on),
  and log out (erases the key and the web storage from the phone).
- **Safety:** HTTPS only; the app refuses to navigate to any host except the chosen server; no JavaScript channel from the
  page into the app.
- **Rotate the admin key:** change `ADMIN_API_KEY` on Liara (and redeploy), open the app → gear → log out, enter the new key.
  If the stored key is refused, the app asks for a new one by itself.
- **Rebuild the APK:** `git push -f origin <branch>:release-admin` (or run «Release admin APK» in the Actions tab). The workflow
  `.github/workflows/release-admin.yml` creates the Android project, patches it (`admin_app/tools/patch_android.py`: application id
  `app.parvandeh.admin` at the top of that file, permissions, label, icon, signing), runs analyze and tests, builds and replaces
  the asset of the release `admin-latest`. It signs with the same `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` secrets as the main app (debug key if
  absent). It never touches `main`, so it does not deploy the server and does not count against the Liara deploy budget.

### Health page

Panel → «سلامت» (works in a browser too). Each card has a green / amber / red dot; «بررسی دوباره» reloads everything.

- **سرور:** version, how long this worker has been up, number of workers (`WEB_CONCURRENCY`), database reachable + query time
  (amber > 300 ms, red > 1 s), database size (Postgres) and row counts of the main tables.
- **آدرس‌ها:** days left on the TLS certificate of `gaamly.ir` and `thecase.liara.run`, checked from the server (cached 10 min).
  Amber under 30 days, red under 14. The old address only turns amber when it fails.
- **محتوا:** how many days of nightly cases are written ahead (amber < 7, red < 3), the last nightly case that opened, the next
  weekend case and when it opens, story season / chapters written / next missing chapter, and whether all content files load.
- **بازیکن‌ها:** total, active today, solves today (Tehran day) and the app-versions table. 5xx counts are not collected yet.
- **امنیت و محدودیت‌ها:** whether `ADMIN_API_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET` are real values (never shown), rate limiter on/off,
  rewarded ads switch, `BAZAAR_MODE`, `ENV`. «Blocked in the last hour» is not counted yet.
- **موجودی لیارا:** the server calls `https://api.liara.ir/v1/billing` with `LIARA_API_TOKEN` and shows the balance in toman.
  The alert limit is `LIARA_MIN_BALANCE` (default 300000): amber up to 1.5× the limit, red at or below it. Cached 5 minutes; the
  button makes at most one real call per 30 seconds. **You must add `LIARA_API_TOKEN` (the same token as the GitHub secret) to
  the Liara app's environment**; until then the card says «LIARA_API_TOKEN روی لیارا تنظیم نشده». The token never leaves the server.
- **GitHub watch:** results are not visible to the server; the card only names the workflows (Server watch every 30 min,
  Liara balance daily 08:00 Tehran).

Also set on Liara (the Health page shows red/amber until then): a long random `ADMIN_API_KEY` (24+ characters) and `JWT_SECRET` (32+).
