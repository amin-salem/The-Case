# Operations notes

What an operator must know or set. Newest topics first.

## Rate limits

One limiter protects the whole API (`server/app/services/ratelimit.py`). The Tuesday anti-cheat task must **reuse it**
(named policies `accuse`, `register`, `register_device`, … and `enforce(name, key)`), not build another.

### How it works

- **Policy table** (`DEFAULTS` in `ratelimit.py`): each policy has one or more *tiers* `limit/seconds`, a burst tier first and a
  sustained tier after it (`accuse` = 1 per 3 s **and** 20 per hour). Tiers with limit ≥ 10 use a sliding-window estimate;
  smaller tiers use exact fixed windows.
- **Routes** (`ROUTES`) map a method + path to a policy. Every request also passes `global_ip`. Not limited at all:
  `/health`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/delete-account`, `/admin/ui`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json`, `/static/*`.
- **Identity**: the player id from a *valid* login token, otherwise the client IP. A forged or expired token counts as "no token".
  Stored keys are salted hashes (never raw IPs or ids). `register_device` / `login_target` also look at client-sent values
  (device id, account, email) but only **in addition** to the IP limit, so changing them never helps an attacker.
- **Client IP**: `X-Forwarded-For` is read only if the socket peer is a private/loopback address (the proxy) and then only the
  entry added by the last trusted hop (`RATE_TRUSTED_HOPS`, default 1 = the last entry). Entries a client wrote itself sit to the
  left and are ignored; a malformed value falls back to the socket address. `start.sh` runs uvicorn with `--no-proxy-headers`
  because uvicorn's own handling with `*` would trust the left (client-written) end.
- **Storage**: *memory* (per worker, bounded to 20 000 keys, expired entries dropped then least-recently-used) for the generous
  limits — with N workers the effective limit is up to N× the number below; the *strict* limits are shared by all workers:
  the `rate_hits` table (atomic `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, Postgres and SQLite) or Redis when `REDIS_URL` is
  set (used automatically; if it fails the database is not used as a silent fallback — the failure policy below applies).
  Rows are deleted by an hourly cleanup in every worker.
- **Failure policy**: if the store errors, generic and strict game limits fail **open** (one log line per policy per 5 minutes:
  `ratelimit store_error …`). `register`, `register_device` and the admin lockout counter fail **closed** — only those routes answer
  `503 {"error":"try_later"}`; the rest of the API keeps working.
- **Kill switch**: `RATE_LIMIT=false` turns the whole limiter off (no checks, no headers).

### Responses

`429 {"error":"rate_limited","message":"<Persian>","retry_after":<seconds>}` with `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Limit`,
`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`. Allowed requests carry the three `X-RateLimit-*` headers too.

### Policies (defaults)

| Policy | Applies to | Key | Limits | Store | Broken store |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| `register_device` | same, by `device_id` | device_id | 3/h | shared | closed |
| `login` | /v1/auth/login, /login/email | IP | 20/60 s, 60/10 min | shared | open |
| `login_target` | same, by player id / email / code | target | 20/10 min | shared | open |
| `transfer` | POST /v1/auth/transfer | IP | 5/5 min | shared | open |
| `account` | /v1/auth/email, /transfer-code | player | 5/10 min | shared | open |
| `accuse` | POST …/accuse | player | 1/3 s, 20/h | shared | open |
| `hint` | POST …/hint | player | 2/5 s, 60/h | shared | open |
| `unlock` | case / riddle unlock | player | 3/10 s, 60/h | shared | open |
| `riddle_answer` | POST …/answer | player | 2/5 s, 60/10 min | shared | open |
| `wallet` | streak freeze, ad reward, mission claim | player | 5/10 s, 60/10 min | shared | open |
| `purchase` | POST /v1/purchases/verify | player | 3/30 s, 20/h | shared | open |
| `story` | story open / skip | player | 3/10 s, 60/h | shared | open |
| `claim` | inbox claim | player | 5/10 s, 60/10 min | shared | open |
| `referral` | redeem invite code | player | 3/60 s, 10/10 min | shared | open |
| `client_info` | POST /v1/me/client | player | 2/60 s, 10/h | memory | open |
| `read` | other GET /v1/* | player or IP | 60/10 s, 1500/10 min | memory | open |
| `write` | other POST/PATCH /v1/* | player or IP | 30/10 s, 900/10 min | memory | open |
| `admin` | /admin/* with a correct key | IP | 60/10 s, 2000/10 min | memory | open |
| `admin_fail` | wrong `X-Admin-Key` | IP | 5 failures → locked for 15 min | shared | closed (admin only) |

### Environment variables (set on Liara; none are required)

- `RL_<POLICY>` overrides one policy, e.g. `RL_ACCUSE=1/3,20/3600` (`limit/seconds`, comma-separated tiers, window ≤ 3600).
  `RL_HINT=off` disables a policy. A bad value is ignored (logged) and the default stays. Names are the upper-case table names:
  `RL_ADMIN_FAIL=5/900` changes the lockout (5 failures, locked for 900 s).
- `RATE_LIMIT=false` — kill switch.
- `REDIS_URL` — optional shared store for the strict limits.
- `RATE_TRUSTED_HOPS` (default 1) — proxies in front of the server. If *all* players look like one IP in the admin Health
  screen (one key with a huge blocked count), raise it; if Liara adds no proxy header, players share the proxy IP, so also raise
  the `global_ip` limit (`RL_GLOBAL_IP`).
- `RATE_TRUSTED_PROXIES` — optional CIDR list allowed to set `X-Forwarded-For` (default: private addresses).
- `RATE_ADMIN_ALLOW_IPS` — comma list of IPs that are never locked out of `/admin`.

### Admin lockout

5 wrong `X-Admin-Key` values from one IP lock that IP out of **all** `/admin` routes for 15 minutes (the right key does not
help while locked; correct keys never cause a lockout). Locks appear in the admin panel → **سلامت** (Health) under «قفل‌های فعال»
with a «برداشتن قفل» button; it is recorded in the admin log (`rl_clear`). If your own IP is locked, open the panel from another
network (mobile data) and clear it there, or wait 15 minutes. The same screen shows blocked requests in the last hour and the
top 5 blocked keys (hashed/shortened).

### For the anti-cheat task

```python
from app.services.ratelimit import enforce, limiter, RateLimited   # RateLimited is turned into the 429 JSON automatically
await enforce("accuse", f"{player.id}")                              # any named policy; key = anything you want limited
```
Add a new policy by adding one line to `DEFAULTS` (and a route to `ROUTES` if it is path-based). Log decisions with one line, no personal data.
