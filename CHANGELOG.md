# Changelog

## 1.1.0 (app build 2, server 1.1.0)

**Cases**
- 44 new cases: **50 in total**, one every night until 17 Nov 2026. 34 are difficulty 4, five are difficulty 5.
- New cases have five suspects, 8–9 pieces of evidence, decoys and a real chain of reasoning (logs, clocks, time zones,
  forged stamps, calendars, arithmetic, logic puzzles).
- The server now refuses a case file with an unknown scene, difficulty outside 1–5, fewer than 5 pieces of evidence or
  fewer than 2 questions per suspect.

**Look and animation**
- 14 new animated scenes (harbor, hospital, library, theater, hotel, kitchen, snow lodge, desert, subway, lab, wedding,
  school, airport, clock tower); fog, floating dust and film flicker on every scene.
- New screen transitions, count-up coins and rewards, confetti on a solved case, pins on evidence, a pulsing "new" tag,
  a collection progress bar, torchlight on the start screen, difficulty shown out of 5.

**Sound**
- A mystery sound bed for every theme, a sting when a case opens, interface sounds, a mute button. All synthesised.

**Checks**
- `server/tools/smoke_test.py` checks that a running server answers every call the app makes.
- Server tests play all 50 cases through the API; app tests check every case parses, every scene paints and every
  sound exists.
- `/health` now also reports the server version.

## 1.0.1
- Server version bump to trigger a Liara deploy.

## 1.0.0
- First release: daily cases, interrogation, accusation with proof, coins, archive, leaderboards, shop, inbox.
